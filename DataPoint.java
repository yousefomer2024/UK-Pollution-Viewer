 * The geographic location is provided in two ways:
 * 
 *   - A gridcode. This is the UK grid code reference as defined by the UK
 *     Ordinance Survey National Grid 
 *     (see https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-to-nationalgrid.pdf)
 *   - An x/y coordinate pair, representing Ordinance Survey National Grid Eastings and Northings 
 *      (see https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/beginners-guide-to-grid-references/)
